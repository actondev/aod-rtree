* <2022-04-15 Fri> 400x400: search 5x5 area fail
  aha. was not updating parent entry after inserting new node

  need to revisit the adjust_tree code, it's a mess
  #+begin_src sh
./build/test/catch-tests [fixme]
  #+end_src

  added a test scanning whole rtree in 5x5 regions. seems fixed!
** <2022-04-16 Sat> refactoring adjust-tree
   after some more bugs, now seems nice & readable
